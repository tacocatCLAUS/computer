# May 22th:
I got started brainstorming and designing the project. I took alot of my insporation from the cyberdeck design of BenMakesEverything but felt it was lacking in a couple ways. 

I think that the best way begin this is to set some goals for the  ***f1laptop:***
- Create a case with a trackball, framework motherboard, battery, micro-controller and apple keyboard (for size)
- Hinge mechanism wighted so that it can hold the full screen and controller chip elevated.
- PCB to connect everything.

Ive been waiting for an oppurtunity to create one of these but especially including the framework motherboard  my project goes overbudget so I will be spending a significant amount of my own money.

# May 23th:
I imported the bottom design files of the BenMakesEverything case and traced the body and screw holes to get the base.

Then I brainstormed a hinge mechnism and came up with this:
