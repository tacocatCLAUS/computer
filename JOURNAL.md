Total time: 5 hours

# May 22nd:
I got started brainstorming and designing the project. I drew a lot of my inspiration from BenMakesEverything's cyberdeck design, but it was lacking in a couple of ways. 

I think that the best way to begin this is to set some goals for the  ***f1laptop:***
- Create a case with a trackball, framework motherboard, battery, micro-controller, and Apple keyboard (for size)
- Hinge mechanism widened so that it can hold the full screen and controller chip elevated.
- PCB to connect everything.

I've been waiting for an opportunity to create one of these but especially including the framework motherboard  my project goes over budget so I will be spending a significant amount of my own money.

# May 23rd:
I imported the bottom design files of the BenMakesEverything case and traced the body and screw holes to get the base.

Model Progress:

Then I brainstormed a hinge mechanism and came up with this:

### Time today: 3 hours


# May 27th:
Turned the 2d base into a 3d case so now a motherboard can go in and be protected.


### Time today: 3 hours


# June 1st:
Realized that to keep size reasonable, I need to but the battery above the motherboard which will cause heating issues so I will need to add fan mounts as well as some kind of heat dissapation and insulation for the battery.

Model Progress:
